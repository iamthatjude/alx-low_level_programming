0. 98 Battery st.

Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98

1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream

Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
-: just like Task 0, you're to just swap values for integers but save the values of both integers in separate variables first before the swap

Ex:
...(type *var1, type *var2)
type var1var = *var1;
type var2var = *var2;

*var1 = var2var;
*var2 = var2var;

2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read

Write a function that returns the length of a string.
-: create a function, receive the pointed value from the parameter then use the strlen() to return the lenght of string without the pointer operator

Ex:
...(type *var)
return (strlen(var));

3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them
